## Keynotes

Next to all activity in the conference center, workshops and talks, off course there were (a few) keynotes. These took place in a great hall an

### Java Keynote: The Future of Java Is Now

At the Java keynote which opened the conference on monday a few speakers were invited. These mostly dealt with outlooks on the future, firstly [Jessica Pointing](https://twitter.com/jessicapointing) talked about the current state and prospects of quantum computing. 

She gave an explanation of what Quantum Computing actually is, and how modern computers can consist of special components (equivalent to transistors in classical computers) to take advantage of the special properties of so-called qubits. 
A Qubit or quantum bit is a unit which can exist in a superposition of states, which means it can be 0 and 1 at the same time, as opposed to a classical bit. 
You can use these properties to devise really specific algorithms like Shor's or Grover's algorithm to solve certain problems like prime factorization much faster.

Keeping the title of the keynote in mind one of the most important questions is "When will we have Quantum Computers?" and as you've already guessed the answer is indeed "Now".  

A fun part of this talk was that there was a live link for the audience to answer a poll to estimate how far along the technology stands in this area. Most of the audience correctly guessed that at present 
we have quantum computers which consist of 10-100 qubits todo: verify this number. Current quantum computers do come with the caveat that they can still only keep their state for a short time.
The advances which still need to be made mostly consist of making sure the quantum properties of the qubits can be kept intact for a longer before we can really speak of sustainable quantum computers.
Nevertheless Jessica really .. the point that the age of quantum computers is in the near future if not now already. She even showed a [github repository](https://github.com/johanvos/quantumjava) which enables everybody to experiment and write
algorithms or programs which can be run on quantum computers (in Java offcourse).

Next Georges Saab officially announced what was already expected, namely that Java 13 was out as of that day:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Java 13 is live: <a href="https://t.co/YqCVg3CTSg">https://t.co/YqCVg3CTSg</a></p>&mdash; Brian Goetz (@BrianGoetz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz/status/1174008054813081600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And next he invited a lot of people from different backgrounds on stage (or on video) to talk about how they experienced the new, faster release cadence of the Java language, which means there is a new version of
Java out every 6 months. These were people who worked on Java at Oracle, with Java on Open Source projects, were part of the JCP, ...

The conclusion of most of these testimonials was that almost everybody was quite suspicious about the idea to do a release every 6 months but that all were pleasantly surprised by how well it seemed to work and
and that they urged everybody to upgrade to the latest versions as soon as possible because there is almost no downside to it.

Lastly it was [Brian Goetz'](https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz/) turn to talk about the future of Java, in which he demonstrated some of the new language features which have been included in the releases
since Java 10, as well as previewed some upcoming stuff. He also gave an extended version of this talk [later](https://t.co/dzzuWze3gX?amp=1)

### Code One Community Keynote: Game On

One of the less serious bet certainly entertaining talks was the community keynote, in which a lot (and we do mean A LOT) of well known people in the Java community (Java Champions, developer advocates, JCP members, ...)
came on stage and acted out a history of the Java language as it has been used in the past. The through line was the idea that Java has been used through the years to help develop video games and 
it continues to be relevant today thanks to all new projects which are springing up everywhere.

It was a bit of a silly show but it was good fun and at the same time interesting to see how far the Java community has come. At some point [Henri Tremblay](https://twitter.com/henri_tremblay) even did some live
coding on a VM running Windows '95 while chatting to his past self via a chatbot, which was truly impressive.

## Usual Suspects

As always, there are a few speakers at every conference who are household names and who always delivery. Some of these you can also go and experience in Belgium at Devoxx or our very own [JOIN](https://ordina-jworks.github.io/join/) conference, like
[Benjamin Nothdurft](https://twitter.com/DataDuke). These talks are always very interesting and of a high standard, but we will only highlight these very briefly.

[Venkat Subramanian](https://twitter.com/venkat_s) gave no less than 6 talks at the conference, 2 of which we were able to attend. These talked about "A Dozen Cool Things You Can Do With JVM Languages"
and "Functional Programming Idioms in Java" in which Venkat shows you things which are really useful but look obvious and vanzeflsprekend when he points them out in his incomparable style.

[Mark Heckler](https://twitter.com/mkheck/status/1174413471674294272) talked about [How to Use Messaging Platforms for Scalabiliy and Performance](https://speakerdeck.com/mkheck/drinking-from-the-stream) and did an impressive live demo
in which he built an application which produced, transformed and consumed events in 3 seperate projects in less than 15 minutes, using Spring Cloud Stream.

Furthermore [Josh Long](https://twitter.com/starbuxman) talked about "The Reactive Revolution" and "Bootiful Testing" while [Stephane Maldini](https://twitter.com/smaldini) gave us an overview of the reasons
why you should (or should not) start using reactive programming.

## Groundbreakers Hub

If you wanted a break from the (literally hundreds of) talks, there was a large area called the [Groundbreakers Hub](https://www.oracle.com/code-one/hub.html) were a lot of like minded tech enthusiasts could gather and discuss
the ongoing conference (in some cases accompanied by a [Blockchain Beer](https://www.facebook.com/OracleCodeOne/photos/a.10150738878780318/10155758354410318/?type=1&theater)).

As always, there were booths of all big representatives at which you could gather information about new products, do some demo coding or collect some nice gadgets. There was also a corner
with arcade game consoles to relax, and also a [Raspberry Pi supercomputer](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/oracle-raspberry-pi-supercomputer,40412.html) on display.

## Streams Workshop

Us

## Using Istio and Kubernetes to Build a Cloud Native Service Mesh

Another workshop which we followed (which was guided by [Ray Tsang](https://twitter.com/saturnism)) showed us how to easily set up an Istio service mesh on a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud. 

-- what is istio --

It was surprisingly easy to set up an entire K8s cluster with service mesh in less than an hour, after which there was still time to try out some of the nice features of a service mesh, like setting up
special routing rules to enable for example Canary deployments or A/B testing scenarios, fault injection / circuit breaking, tracing, ... Which can all be handled by Istio itself without making any
changes to your application (except for propagating the headers which are required for tracing). Also a lot of added on applications like Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, ... all worked straight out of the box.

For the workshop we received special temporary accounts but if you use your own account (which has a free trial option) you can certainly try and follow the steps in the very extensive [Read-through](https://github.com/retroryan/istio-workshop)
to set this up yourselves.

## Monitor Kafka Like a Pro

A subject close to our own workshop was presented by [Viktor Gamov](https://twitter.com/gamussa), a developer advocate for Confluent. He talked about best practices for monitoring your Kafka clusters
in a very interesting [presentation](--).

## DevOps Theory vs. Practice: A Song of Ice and Tire Fire

One of the last, slightly more lighthearted talks took place on the last afternoon of the conference. [Baruch Sadogursky](https://twitter.com/jbaruch) and [Viktor Gamov](https://twitter.com/gamussa) opened
their talk with a skit in which Baruch spouted well known DevOps clichÃ©s, like "Everything must be 100% automated", "We do Continuous Security well" or "You're problems are so unique, no vendor can possibly understand them"
while Viktor translated this into the harsh truth that none of these are absolute or applicable in every situation and you have to adopt your approach accordingly. While entertaining, it also laid bare the truth that none of these
devops principles act as a Silver Bullet. 

Using the analogy of the Cargo Cult, a term which originated in the story of people in Oceania who after the Second World War was over started building airplanes out of straw, believing that these
would bring the technological advancements and prosperity (cargo) which arrived on these islands at the same time as the actual airplanes. The analogy is that in modern tech, some people might believe that
by merely adopting the latest techniques and tools (Kubernetes, Docker, DevOps, ...), automatically all other problems will solve themselves. From experience, we all know this isn't true.

Instead, we should analyze were we are (as an organisation) and determine which steps to take to progress to where we want to be before just adopting something like Kafka because people at 
conferences give nice demos and workshops and tell you all will be alright. 
Before we take a decision like this we first need to be aware of the answers to The Four Questions:

![](/img/oracle-code-one-2019/four-questions.png)

Answering the last 2 questions require an entirely different talk, but the first one we can try and tackly using a maturity model, popularized by [Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/MaturityModel.html).
Maturity models have their own share of problems and critics, but Baruch and Viktor pose that, if done right, they can help your organization or team make signifant 
advancements towards being ready to tackle your business problems in a more efficient way.

Now the question is "How do you write a *good* maturity model?". Using an example, simply created in Excel, Viktor and Baruch try to explain that the most important things to
take into account for a maturity model are:

- It should describe a process, not an end goal. 
- It should be tailored specific to your case, not exactly as prescribed in "the book".
- It should focus on outcomes, not specific tools to use.
- It should constantly be evaluated and evolve, not written once and then forgotten.

![](/img/oracle-code-one-2019/dos-donts.png)

The answer to the question "Is it even a good tech?" can be answered by advisory / research companies like Forrester or Gartner but because these are for-profit
companies their suggestions might be skewed towards the companies which are already established / rich or more in the limelight. A better option might be to look
at the [Thoughtworks Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) which is publicly available and provides an assesment of a whole array of modern
technologies and determines if you should Adopt, Asses, Trial or Hold these.

Moreover, you could argue that it's even better to extend the question to "Is this even a good tech *for our team*", in which case it's a good idea to [build your own tech radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/how-to-byor)
which offcourse at Jworks we [already did](https://ordina-jworks.github.io/tech-radar).
